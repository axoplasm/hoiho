I never expected my birthday reminder app to subvert democracy. I would pay *real American money* for Friendster 2.0 if it did nothing but remind me of my cousins’ birthdays & HS friends’ kids’ softball games.

Hoiho is a notional paid service that lets you:
-----------------------------------------------

- aggregate contact data for all the people you know in real life
- knit them together into networks so you can see who *they* know in real life
- keep those networks separate enough so that your church group won’t see who you’re dating
- send photos of your kids’ softball games to your high school friends
- remind you of your cousins’ birthdays
- pay a small monthly fee to keep Hoiho running *(“if you’re not paying for it, you’re the product…”)*
- a [rare antisocial penguin](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50374092) that communicates with a high-pitched scream

Hoiho isn’t:
------------

- an ad platform
- a microblogging service for thinkfluencers
- a publicly-browsable social graph
- a miserable snitch hoovering up your personal data for resale to marketing goblins
- a goddamn social network

Yes but what about the FEATURES, huh?
-------------------------------------

And the business plan? And the product spec? And the tech stack? And the license? And the contributors’ guidelines? 

__*When can I buy this and what will I get for my money?*__

Keep your pants on. The wiki has a proposed [product definition](https://github.com/axoplasm/hoiho/wiki/Product-definition).
